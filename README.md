This Unity 2019.2.1f1 project is a base from which I plan to make my game jam games.  I welcome anyone else to use it as well.  I do this so that all the parts of the games I make are from me or the team members I work with, and the basic setup of menus, git ignores, projects settings, etc. are not time sinks.
